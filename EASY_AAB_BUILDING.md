# 3. Use GitHub Actions (free)
```

### **🤖 GitHub Actions Workflow**
I'll create the workflow file for you:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/build-aab.yml
name: Build AAB

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Set up JDK 17
      uses: actions/setup-java@v3
      with:
        java-version: '17'
        distribution: 'temurin'
    - name: Build AAB
      run: ./gradlew bundleRelease
    - name: Upload AAB
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3
      with:
        name: app-release-aab
        path: app/build/outputs/bundle/release/
```

## Method 3: Docker Build (Local)

### **🐳 Use Pre-built Android Docker**
```bash
# 1. Install Docker on your computer
# 2. Run this command:
docker run --rm -v $(pwd):/workspace -w /workspace openjdk:17-jdk-slim ./gradlew bundleRelease
```

## Method 4: Browser-Based Build

### **🌐 Gitpod.io (Free Cloud IDE)**
```bash
# 1. Go to https://gitpod.io
# 2. Sign in with GitHub
# 3. Open your ZenFitAI repository
# 4. Terminal will open automatically
# 5. Run: ./gradlew bundleRelease
```

## Method 5: Manual Command Line (Advanced)

### **🔧 Complete Setup Script**
```bash
# Save this as build-aab.sh
#!/bin/bash
echo "Building ZenFit AI AAB..."

# Clean previous builds
./gradlew clean

# Build AAB
./gradlew bundleRelease

# Check if build succeeded
if [ -f "app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab" ]; then
    echo "✅ AAB built successfully!"
    echo "Location: app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab"
else
    echo "❌ Build failed"
fi
```

## 🎯 **Recommended Path: GitHub Actions**

**Why GitHub Actions is best:**
- ✅ Completely free (2000 minutes/month)
- ✅ No software installation needed
- ✅ Automatic on every code push
- ✅ Professional CI/CD pipeline
- ✅ Works from any computer/phone

### **Quick GitHub Actions Setup:**
1. **Create GitHub account** (if you don't have one)
2. **Create new repository** called "zenfit-ai"
3. **Upload your project files**
4. **I'll provide the exact workflow file**
